# GitHub Repository Setup

Since the repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet, please follow these steps to create it and push the code:

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/shreyanshjain7174
2. Click "New" to create a new repository
3. Repository name: `rook-ceph-mcp`
4. Description: `MCP server for Rook Ceph storage operations`
5. Make it public
6. **Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license** (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Push main branch
git push -u origin main

# Push dev branch
git push -u origin dev

# Push staging branch
git push -u origin staging
```

## Step 3: Verify Deployment

After pushing, verify the branches are available:

```bash
git branch -r
```

## Branch Structure

Your repository will have the following structure:

- **main** - Production Context with enterprise features
- **staging** - Staging Context with production-like settings  
- **dev** - Development Context with relaxed settings

## Repository Features

Each branch contains:
- Environment-specific Ceph cluster configurations
- Kustomization files for deployment
- Environment variables
- Complete MCP server implementation
- Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
2. Configure branch protection rules
3. Set up automated testing
4. Configure deployment workflows

## Current Status

✅ Local repository with all branches ready
✅ Commits with proper messages and co-authorship
✅ Environment-specific configurations
✅ Complete documentation
⏳ Waiting for GitHub repository creation
⏳ Ready to push all branches

## Commands Ready to Execute

Once repository is created:

```bash
# Push all branches
git push -u origin main
git push -u origin staging  
git push -u origin dev

# Verify
git remote -v
git branch -r
```
